# nano_C
Calculates electronic properties of various carbon nanostructures. 

To run: Create folders in the local path titled 'Data' and 'Figures' to store outputs. Configure parameters such as supercell dimensions, cutoff energy, and number of k-points in main.m. Then call main(nanostructure), where nanostructure is a char vector describing the structure (e.g. 'graphene', '5-agnr', '(10,0)-cnt', etc.)
